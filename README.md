## Web Scraping with ETL Process and Logging
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a website and perform a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. The ETL pipeline extracts raw data, transforms it for better usability, and loads it into a structured format. Additionally, each step of the process is logged for better traceability and debugging.

Features:
Web Scraping: Collects data from the specified website.
ETL Pipeline:
Extract: Scrapes raw data.
Transform: Cleans and processes the data for consistency.
Load: Stores the processed data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, database).
Logging: Every step of the process is logged to ensure traceability and aid in debugging.
